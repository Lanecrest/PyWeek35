Road Map
=
Core gameplay functionality is implemented. Next up I want to make a proper sprite for the player/shadow (the radition energy and shadow rays will probably just stay cube-like objects).

After that, I want to make the controls a bit tighter, maybe make jumping be linked to how long you hold space, or improve collision a bit.

I also need to make a title screen that says how to play!
