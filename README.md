# Gameplay
Embiggen your shadow to a cromulent size. Shadow barriers will hurt your shadow if they come in contact so blast them away! Blasting them away will also embiggen your shadow. Don't lose your shadow or time out! Win by making your shadow huge.

-Optimized some code in some places

-Added some sound effects using stock Arcade sounds

-Gameplay has been changed up to be more SHMUP (shoot'em up) style so you know have free movement and now instead of collecting energy, you shoot energy! Your shadow embiggens organically so you need to blast the neutrinos that are chipping away at your shadow.

-Gameplay has been changed up to be more SHMUP (shoot'em up) style so you know have free movement and now instead of collecting energy, you shoot energy! Your shadow embiggens organically so you need to blast the neutrinos that are chipping away at your shadow.

v0.2.1 (03-26-23)
-

v0.1.0 (03-26-23)
-
-Initial release, simple script using Arcade to move a sprite left to right and jumping

-Player's shadow is implemented. It follows the player position and gets bigger/smaller, lighter/darker based on the players Y position.


Road Map
=
Core gameplay functionality is implemented. Next up I want to make a proper sprite for the player/shadow (the radition energy and shadow rays will probably just stay cube-like objects).

After that, I want to make the controls a bit tighter, maybe make jumping be linked to how long you hold space, or improve collision a bit.

I also need to make a title screen that says how to play!
