-Initial release, simple script using Arcade to move a sprite left to right and jumping

-Player's shadow is implemented. It follows the player position and gets bigger/smaller, lighter/darker based on the players Y position.


Road Map
=
The plan is to make a game where you have to pay attention to both the player sprite and the shadow sprite. Currently the plan is to have one object avoid obstacles and the other object collect items, but that may change as development progresses.

Time permitting, the sprites will be something fancier than solid squares, but I am a programmer first and an artist, last, after everything else :D
