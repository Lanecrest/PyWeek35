# Shadow Embiggener

Embiggen your shadow to a cromulent size! This game plays like a SHMUP (shoot'em up). Shadow barriers will hurt your shadow if they come in contact so blast them away! You win when you embiggen to 100%. Collect power ups to embiggen and if your shadow is hit by too many barriers, you lose!

About
=
This game uses the Arcade library and has only been tested in Windows but should be cross-platform. The keyboard is the only input device needed, using the arrow or WSAD keys to move and space to shoot. There are some Simpsons references sprinkled about, if the title wasn't already a give away :)
