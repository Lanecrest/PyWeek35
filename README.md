# Gameplay
Embiggen your shadow to a cromulent size. This game plays like a SHMUP (shoot'em up). Shadow barriers will hurt your shadow if they come in contact so blast them away! If you lose your shadow, you lose the game! Collect power ups to embiggen your shadow. You win when you embiggen to 100%

v0.5.0 (03-29-23)
-
-Re-added power ups which embiggen your shadow

Road Map

As the challenge makes it to the half way point, the biggest obstacle left is hit detection improvement. As this is developed for PyWeek 35 challenge there are no immediate plans to develop this project after the one week challenge has concluded.
