Road Map
=
Basic gameplay is implemented. Scoring will be changed so the game ends when your score gets to a certain size (you lose if it disappears). The score is based on how quickly you get it to the target size. The shadow rays will also get bigger as the game goes on.

Time permitting, the sprites will be something fancier than solid squares, but I am a programmer first and an artist, last, after everything else :D
