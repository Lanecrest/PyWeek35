# Gameplay
Embiggen your shadow to a cromulent size. This game plays like a SHMUP (shoot'em up). Shadow barriers will hurt your shadow if they come in contact so blast them away! If you lose your shadow, you lose the game! Collect power ups to embiggen your shadow. You win when you embiggen to 100%

Changelog

v0.5.0 (03-29-23)
-
-Re-added power ups which embiggen your shadow

-Removed time limit and time loss, now scoring is based on how long you take to embiggen to 100% and how many times your shadow gets hit.

-Changed background sprite. All sprites and sounds are probably final at this point

v0.4.0 (03-28-23)
-
-Scoring changed to hitting shadows barriers with your energy blasts makes your shadow bigger, shadow getting hit makes it smaller.

-Implemented a title screen

-Optimized some code in some places

-Updated readme/license

-Added some sound effects using stock Arcade sounds

-Gameplay has been changed up to be more SHMUP (shoot'em up) style so you know have free movement and now instead of collecting energy, you shoot energy! Your shadow embiggens organically so you need to blast the neutrinos that are chipping away at your shadow.

v0.3.0 (03-27-23)
-
-Added a crude player sprite and an even cruder background

-Gameplay has been changed up to be more SHMUP (shoot'em up) style so you know have free movement and now instead of collecting energy, you shoot energy! Your shadow embiggens organically so you need to blast the neutrinos that are chipping away at your shadow.

v0.2.1 (03-26-23)
-
-Scoring system now implemented. You want to embiggen your shadow to a certain size to win! If time runs out, your shadow will leave, and if it shrinks to much from the shadow rays it will die!

v0.2.0 (03-26-23)
-
-Added energy and shadowray cubes, that will increase or decrease the shadow size respectively. The player interacts with energy and the shadow with shadowrays.


v0.1.0 (03-26-23)
-
-Initial release, simple script using Arcade to move a sprite left to right and jumping

-Player's shadow is implemented. It follows the player position and gets bigger/smaller, lighter/darker based on the players Y position.


Road Map
=
Core gameplay functionality is implemented. Next up I want to make a proper sprite for the player/shadow (the radition energy and shadow rays will probably just stay cube-like objects).

After that, I want to make the controls a bit tighter, maybe make jumping be linked to how long you hold space, or improve collision a bit.

I also need to make a title screen that says how to play!
