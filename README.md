# Gameplay
Embiggen your shadow to a cromulent size! This game plays like a SHMUP (shoot'em up). Shadow barriers will hurt your shadow if they come in contact so blast them away! You win when you embiggen to 100%. Collect power ups to embiggen and if your shadow is hit by too many barriers, you lose!

v0.5.0 (03-29-23)
-
-Re-added power ups which embiggen your shadow
